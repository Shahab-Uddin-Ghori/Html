        <abbr title="Hyper text markup language">HTML</abbr>is like a blueprint
        for your website. It builds the basic structure by telling the computer
        what goes where: headings, paragraphs, pictures, links, and more. It
        doesn't make it fancy, just lays the foundation. Think of it like the
        skeleton of your website, waiting for the skin and muscles (CSS and
        JavaScript) to bring it to life!

        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is like the makeup
        artist for your website! It takes the plain HTML structure and adds
        color, style, and personality. It allows you to control things like font
        size, colors, backgrounds, and layout, making your website visually
        appealing and user-friendly. Think of it as the finishing touch that
        transforms a barebones website into a beautiful and engaging experience.

        respond, and change based on user actions.
